# Proposal 1
#### Approaches to Developmental Embodied Neurosimulation. 
In this talk, I will review our lab's approaches to Developmental Embodied Neurosimulation using agent-based approaches. Utilizing a developmental version of the Braitenberg Vehicle, we demonstrate the developmental process as being a combination of embodied neural network morphogenesis, differentially-timed internal processes, and supervised acquisition. We also utilize a population approach that enables the natural selection of innate components as well as dual inheritance of innate and cultural components. To conclude, we will consider the direct perception as a form of Gibsonian Information, which can provide a means to assess the information content of perceptual order in a variety of environmental contexts: sensory deprivation, dynamic multisensory worlds, and collective behaviors.
